As Covid-19 is understood to be transmitted through air and physical contact, the conditions in which a population live could greatly impact upon the transmission of the virus. Only a fraction of these infections leads to death so it is important to note that only fatalities, and not infections, are considered. This study explores socio-economic circumstances across England by classifying the country into more than 300 distinct districts, based on the 2011 census. Health, wealth and living conditions data are selected in the hope of identifying trends and causality which can paint a clearer picture of the Covid-19 pandemic.
