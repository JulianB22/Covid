Conclusion

In relation to the original hypothesis, we can observe that whilst Covid-19 deaths are negatively correlated with areas of low deprivation and high affluence, the underlying driver of this relationship is in fact the health and disabilities issues which are very prevalent in those districts. A relative importance matrix (Box 14) supports this notion that Health_and_Disability is a more influential factor as, when compared to Hourly_Pay (0.087) and Urban (0.393), its relative importance metric is comfortably the largest (0.520). The p-value of 4.181e-15 means the null hypothesis can be safely rejected. This means that there is a statistically significant difference between the deaths from Covid-19 (dependent variable) and health, pay and proportion of urban population of a district (independent variables). The statistical difference suggests that the model does have some level of predictive power over Covid Deaths.  

However, it is important to recognise the considerable limitations in this study such as the strength of the trends identified. Whilst collinearity between independent variables had high internal correlation coefficients of 0.8+, any correlations with the dependent variable were moderate at best. This suggests that the link between Covid-19 deaths and health and disabilities is noticeable but not compelling. 

The low adjusted r squared value (0.19) also argues that the multiple linear regression model fails to explain large parts of the dependent variable so there must be other phenomena outside of the data which may be more telling. This value is not much lower than when all the independent variables were included (Model 2).

A further limitation is the time gap between the dependent variable and the Census data which was used in the independent variables. It is very possible that, between 2011 and 2020, there were certain changes in the socio-economic environment which would have better explained the Covid-19 pandemic.
