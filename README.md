This study uses RStudio to examine the link between living conditions and deaths by Covid-19 in England.Â 

A variety of different socio-economic factors are examined, including measures of neighbourhood health, deprivation, social grade, GDHI and hourly pay.

The country is classified into more than 300 distinct districts based on the 2011 census.

Different quantative data analysis processes are carried out including:

Spearman correlation tests

Factor analyses

Multiple linear regressions

Principal components analyses

Relative importance matrices

Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests

Shapiro-Wilk tests

Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin tests

CONCLUSION

Covid-19 deaths are positively correlated with areas of high deprivation and low affluence.
The underlying driver of this relationship is in fact the health and disabilities issues which are more prevalent in such districts.

LIMITATIONS

Internal correlation between indepedent variables was high whilst any correlations with the dependent variable were moderate at best. 
This suggests that the link between Covid-19 deaths and health and disabilities is noticeable but not compelling.

The low adjusted r-squared value of the the multiple linear regression model means it fails to explain large parts of the dependent variable.
Therefore there must be other phenomena outside of the data which may be more telling. 

There is a significant time gap between the dependent variable and the Census data which was used in the independent variables. 
Between 2011 and 2020, there may have been changes in the socio-economic environment which better explain the Covid-19 pandemic.
